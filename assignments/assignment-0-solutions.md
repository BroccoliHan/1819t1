### Common Mistaks

#### Problem 1

- "-3" : You should check the number in range(a, b+1), NOT range(a, b). Because b should be included.
- "-5" : The function could not be executed successfully even with the example input.

#### Problem 2

- "-2" : Didn't make sure that 0 <= n <= 9.
- "-4" : Didn't make sure the data type of n is 'int'.
- "-6" : Didn't do both things above.
- "-5" : The function could not be executed successfully even with the example input.

#### Problem 3

- "-5" : The function could not be executed successfully with the input of [1, 3, -2, 4, 8, 9, 0, 5]

- "-8" : Had both errors above
- others: You didn't count the frequency of the words or misunderstood the meaning of the problem

#### Problem 6

- "-3" : Didn't remove '\n' when reading the csv file.
- "-5" : The function could not be executed successfully even with the example input.

#### Problem 7
